## Overview
This repository contains the code for preprocessing and analyzing the CASE dataset. Follow the steps below to execute the code in the provided Jupyter notebooks.
IMPORTANT: The statistical_analysis notebook is very big because it is meant to be used with a table of contents. Please consider opening the notebook in an environment that supports this functionality, for easier navigation.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps to Run the Code
### 1. Open and Run the case1_preprocessing Notebook

- Open the case1_preprocessing.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

- Set CPA = False and run all cells.

- After completion, set CPA = True and run all cells again.

### 2. Open and Run the statistical_analysis Notebook
- Open the case1_statistical_analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

- Set CPA = False and run all cells.

- After completion, set CPA = True and run all cells again.
